# Requirements: Opencode System Authentication

**Defined:** 2026-01-19
**Core Value:** Secure remote access to your opencode instance from anywhere — authenticate once with your system credentials, work on your projects from any device.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Authentication

- [x] **AUTH-01**: User can log in with username and password via web form
- [x] **AUTH-02**: Credentials validated against system PAM (supports LDAP/Kerberos transparently)
- [x] **AUTH-03**: Authenticated session maps to real UNIX user (UID/GID)
- [x] **AUTH-04**: Commands and file operations execute under authenticated user's identity
- [x] **AUTH-05**: User can optionally enable 2FA via TOTP (PAM module integration)

### Sessions

- [x] **SESS-01**: Session stored as secure cookie (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict)
- [x] **SESS-02**: User can log out, clearing session cookie and server-side state
- [x] **SESS-03**: Session expires after configurable idle timeout
- [x] **SESS-04**: "Remember me" option extends session lifetime for trusted devices

### Security

- [x] **SEC-01**: CSRF protection on login form and state-changing operations
- [x] **SEC-02**: Warning displayed when connecting over HTTP on public network
- [x] **SEC-03**: Rate limiting on failed login attempts (IP-based per user decision)
- [x] **SEC-04**: Option to refuse login over insecure HTTP connections

### Infrastructure

- [x] **INFRA-01**: Auth broker (setuid helper) handles PAM authentication and user process spawning
- [x] **INFRA-02**: Unix socket IPC between unprivileged web server and privileged auth broker
- [x] **INFRA-03**: Auth configuration via opencode.json (enabled, sessionTimeout, rememberMe, etc.)
- [x] **INFRA-04**: Auth disabled by default; existing single-user behavior unchanged

### User Interface

- [x] **UI-01**: Login page with username/password form matching opencode design
- [x] **UI-02**: Password visibility toggle (eye icon to show/hide)
- [x] **UI-03**: Session activity indicator showing username with logout access
- [x] **UI-04**: Connection security badge (lock icon for HTTPS, warning for HTTP)

### Documentation

- [x] **DOC-01**: Reverse proxy setup guide (nginx, Caddy) with TLS configuration examples
- [x] **DOC-02**: PAM service file configuration and troubleshooting documentation

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Advanced Authentication

- **AUTH-V2-01**: User can authenticate via SSH key (passwordless)
- **AUTH-V2-02**: User can view and revoke other active sessions (multi-session awareness)

### Privilege Escalation

- **PRIV-01**: User can elevate privileges for admin actions (sudo prompts in UI)
- **PRIV-02**: Polkit integration for fine-grained action authorization

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature                      | Reason                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Custom user database         | Duplicates OS user management; PAM delegates to passwd/LDAP/Kerberos           |
| Built-in TLS termination     | Complex, error-prone; better handled by nginx/Caddy reverse proxy              |
| OAuth/SSO for self-hosted    | PAM already supports enterprise SSO via LDAP/Kerberos integration              |
| Account registration         | Self-hosted instances use existing system accounts; admins manage via OS tools |
| Password reset via email     | No email infrastructure assumed; users reset via admin/sudo                    |
| Fine-grained app permissions | Use existing UNIX permission model and sudo/polkit                             |
| Anonymous/guest access       | Defeats purpose of system authentication                                       |
