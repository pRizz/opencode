### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 12 added: Server-Side TOTP Registration - offload .google_authenticator file generation to server
- Phase 13 added: Passkeys Investigation - investigate adding passkeys and passkey management to opencode auth
- Phase 14 added: Persistent Session Storage - add persistent session storage for multi-instance deployments
- Phase 15 added: Update docs to use opencode fork (pRizz) - point documentation to https://github.com/pRizz/opencode which has the auth implementation
- Phase 16 added: Allow the user to download git repos so that they can work on them with their opencode sessions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

From research summary (Phase 2, 3 flags):

- Bun N-API compatibility with PAM libraries needs runtime verification
- PTY ownership with user impersonation via bun-pty needs testing

**Resolved:**

- macOS PAM crate compatibility - resolved by using nonstick instead of pam-client
- PTY allocation on macOS - working with platform-specific ptsname
- macOS initgroups type - resolved with platform-specific gid type casting
