subsystem: auth
tags: [rust, pam, nonstick, tokio, serde, governor, ipc]

# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-configuration-foundation
    provides: opencode.json config schema with auth section
provides:
  - Rust project scaffold for auth broker
  - IPC protocol types (Request, Response, AuthenticateParams)
  - Config loading from opencode.json with defaults
affects: [03-02, 03-03]

# Tech tracking

  - "IPC Request/Response with flattened params for method-specific data"
  - "Config walk-up: search for opencode.json from cwd to root"

# Phase 03 Plan 01: Auth Broker Project Init Summary

**Rust auth broker project with nonstick PAM bindings, IPC protocol types, and config loading from opencode.json**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T13:06:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T13:14:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files created:** 6

## Accomplishments

- Initialized Rust project with all required dependencies in packages/opencode-broker
- Created IPC protocol types with password redaction (6 tests)
- Implemented config loading with opencode.json walk-up search (9 tests)
- All 15 tests pass, clippy clean

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Initialize Rust project with dependencies** - `aedbb05` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create IPC protocol types** - `07a44ab` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create config loading module** - `6d1351f` (feat)
4. **Clippy fixes** - `a87ec0d` (style)

## Files Created

- `packages/opencode-broker/Cargo.toml` - Project manifest with dependencies
- `packages/opencode-broker/src/lib.rs` - Library exports
- `packages/opencode-broker/src/main.rs` - Entry point with tracing init
- `packages/opencode-broker/src/config.rs` - BrokerConfig and load_config()
- `packages/opencode-broker/src/ipc/mod.rs` - IPC module exports
- `packages/opencode-broker/src/ipc/protocol.rs` - Request/Response message types

## Decisions Made

1. **Used nonstick instead of pam-client** - pam-client (and pam-client2, pam 0.8) all fail on macOS due to pam-sys bindgen generating types incompatible with OpenPAM. nonstick was the backup option mentioned in RESEARCH.md and compiles cleanly on macOS.

2. **Password redaction approach** - Two-layer protection: custom Debug impl shows [REDACTED], and #[serde(skip_serializing)] prevents accidental serialization to logs.

3. **Platform socket paths** - Linux uses /run/opencode/auth.sock (FHS 3.0), macOS uses /var/run/opencode/auth.sock.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Switched from pam-client to nonstick crate**

- **Found during:** Task 1 (project initialization)
- **Issue:** pam-client 0.5 depends on pam-sys which generates bindings incompatible with macOS OpenPAM. Multiple PAM constants (PAM_BAD_ITEM, PAM_CONV_AGAIN, PAM_INCOMPLETE) don't exist in OpenPAM.
- **Fix:** Switched to nonstick 0.1.1 which has its own libpam-sys bindings designed for cross-platform support.
- **Files modified:** packages/opencode-broker/Cargo.toml
- **Verification:** cargo build succeeds on macOS
- **Committed in:** aedbb05

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking issue)
**Impact on plan:** Necessary for macOS compatibility. nonstick was the documented backup option in RESEARCH.md.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the PAM crate compatibility issue (documented above).

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Rust project compiles and tests pass
- IPC protocol types ready for socket server implementation
- Config loading ready for broker daemon
- Ready for Plan 02: PAM authentication implementation
