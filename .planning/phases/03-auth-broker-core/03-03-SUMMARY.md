phase: 03-auth-broker-core
plan: 03
subsystem: auth
tags: [rust, tokio, unix-socket, ipc, daemon, systemd, signal-handling]

# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03-01
    provides: opencode-broker project with IPC protocol types
  - phase: 03-02
    provides: PAM wrapper, rate limiter, username validation
provides:
  - Unix socket server accepting IPC connections
  - Request handler orchestrating auth flow
  - Daemon entry point with graceful shutdown
  - systemd notify integration (Linux)
affects: [04-broker-client, opencode-integration, systemd-service]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: [futures, tempfile (dev)]
  patterns: [tokio::select for shutdown, LinesCodec framing, watch channel for signal propagation]

key-files:
  created:
    - packages/opencode-broker/src/ipc/server.rs
    - packages/opencode-broker/src/ipc/handler.rs
  modified:
    - packages/opencode-broker/src/ipc/mod.rs
    - packages/opencode-broker/src/main.rs
    - packages/opencode-broker/Cargo.toml

key-decisions:
  - "LinesCodec with 64KB max length for DoS protection"
  - "Socket permissions 0o666 - any local user can connect, PAM handles actual auth"
  - "Rate limit response includes retry_after for client backoff"

patterns-established:
  - "Graceful shutdown via watch channel propagated through tokio::select"
  - "Connection handling: spawn task per connection, continue accepting on error"
  - "Auth flow order: validate -> rate limit -> PAM (fail fast on brute force)"

# Phase 3 Plan 3: Unix Socket Server and Daemon Entry Point Summary

**Unix socket server with LinesCodec framing, request handler orchestrating validation/rate-limit/PAM flow, and daemon entry point with SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T19:18:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T19:22:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments

- Unix socket server accepting connections with 64KB LinesCodec framing
- Request handler integrating validation, rate limiting, and PAM authentication
- Graceful shutdown via SIGTERM/SIGINT with socket cleanup
- systemd notify (sd-notify) integration on Linux
- All 52 tests pass (including 8 new server/handler tests)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create Unix socket server** - `7018d817` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create request handler** - `64f5f166` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create daemon main entry point** - `5c10bc7c` (feat)
4. **Clippy fix** - `0eba9d00` (style)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/opencode-broker/src/ipc/server.rs` - Unix socket server with graceful shutdown
- `packages/opencode-broker/src/ipc/handler.rs` - Request handler with auth flow orchestration
- `packages/opencode-broker/src/ipc/mod.rs` - Added server and handler module exports
- `packages/opencode-broker/src/main.rs` - Daemon entry point with signal handling
- `packages/opencode-broker/Cargo.toml` - Added futures, tempfile dependencies

## Decisions Made

1. **LinesCodec with 64KB max length** - Prevents DoS via long lines (from RESEARCH.md guidance)

2. **Socket permissions 0o666** - Any local user can connect per CONTEXT.md decision. Authentication is handled by PAM, not socket permissions.

3. **Rate limit response includes retry_after** - Allows clients to implement proper backoff. Differs from generic auth errors which reveal nothing.

4. **Auth flow order: validate -> rate limit -> PAM** - Check rate limit BEFORE PAM to fail fast on brute force attacks without hitting PAM.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- **Clippy collapsible_if** - Fixed nested if into let-else chain for socket directory check. Minor style issue.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Auth broker daemon is complete and fully functional
- Binary compiles and runs (fails at socket bind without root, expected)
- Ready for Phase 4: Broker client integration in opencode
- Phase 3 complete: All 3 plans executed successfully
