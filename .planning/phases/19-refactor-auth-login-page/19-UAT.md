## Current Test

<!-- OVERWRITE each test - shows where we are -->

number: complete
name: UAT complete (with skips)
expected: N/A
awaiting: none

## Tests

### 1. Login page visual parity

expected: `/auth/login` matches prior login UI (layout, typography, spacing, colors, logo).
result: pass (Playwright screenshots: `.playwright-mcp/uat-login-desktop.png`)

### 2. HTTP warning dismissal

expected: On HTTP (non-local), warning shows; dismiss hides it and persists for session via `http-warning-dismissed`.
result: skipped (per user request)

### 3. HTTPS required block

expected: When HTTPS is required, login shows blocked message, disables inputs, and hides submit button.
result: skipped (per user request)

### 4. Remember-me default

expected: Remember me is checked by default.
result: pass (Playwright snapshot shows checkbox checked)

### 5. Login error handling

expected: Invalid credentials show error message; submit button re-enables.
result: pass (Playwright shows "Authentication failed" after invalid login)

### 6. TOTP required redirect

expected: Valid credentials with TOTP enabled redirect to `/auth/2fa` with token params.
result: skipped (per user request)

### 7. TOTP setup required redirect

expected: Users needing setup are redirected to `/auth/2fa/setup` (or `?required=1`).
result: skipped (per user request)

### 8. Mobile responsiveness

expected: At ~320–480px width, layout remains usable with no clipping/overlap.
result: pass (Playwright screenshots: `.playwright-mcp/uat-login-mobile.png`)

## Summary
