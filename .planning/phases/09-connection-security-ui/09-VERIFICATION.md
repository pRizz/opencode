| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| UI-04: Connection security badge (lock icon for HTTPS, warning for HTTP) | ✓ SATISFIED | All supporting truths verified |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| None | -    | -       | -        | -      |

No anti-patterns detected. All implementations are substantive with real logic.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Visual appearance of SecurityBadge

**Test:**

1. Access opencode over HTTPS
2. Verify green lock icon appears in titlebar
3. Click the lock icon
4. Verify popover shows "Secure Connection" with encryption message

**Expected:**

- Green lock icon clearly visible in titlebar
- Popover opens smoothly with readable text
- Message explains HTTPS encryption

**Why human:** Visual design, color perception, and UX feel cannot be verified programmatically

#### 2. HTTP warning banner visibility

**Test:**

1. Access opencode over HTTP from non-localhost (e.g., ngrok tunnel or remote IP)
2. Verify amber warning banner appears below titlebar
3. Read warning message
4. Click dismiss button
5. Refresh page
6. Verify banner does not reappear

**Expected:**

- Amber/yellow banner clearly visible and readable
- Warning text explains security risk
- Dismiss button works
- Dismissal persists across page loads

**Why human:** Visual prominence, message clarity, and localStorage persistence need real browser testing

#### 3. Localhost detection accuracy

**Test:**

1. Access opencode from `http://localhost:PORT`
2. Verify blue home icon appears (NOT red warning)
3. Verify no warning banner appears
4. Try `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`
5. Try `http://[::1]:PORT` (IPv6 localhost)

**Expected:**

- Blue home icon for all localhost variants
- No warning banner for local connections
- Tooltip says "Local connection"

**Why human:** Network configuration and browser behavior varies by environment

#### 4. Tab visibility re-check

**Test:**

1. Open opencode in HTTP tab (red icon/warning)
2. Switch to another browser tab
3. Configure reverse proxy to serve HTTPS
4. Switch back to opencode tab
5. Verify icon updates to green lock

**Expected:**

- Security status re-checks when tab becomes visible
- Icon color changes from red to green
- Warning banner disappears (if previously shown)

**Why human:** Browser visibility API behavior and timing are environment-specific

## Verification Summary

Phase 9 goal **achieved**. All required artifacts exist, are substantive (not stubs), and are properly wired into the application.

**Evidence:**

- SecurityBadge component: 107 lines with three distinct states (secure/insecure/local)
- HttpWarningBanner component: 61 lines with localStorage persistence
- Icon library extended with lock, lock-open, home icons
- Layout integration complete: both components rendered in correct positions
- Security detection logic wired to window.location
- Popover integration working for click-to-details
- No stub patterns, TODO comments, or placeholder implementations found

**Human verification needed** for visual appearance, UX feel, and real-world browser testing, but all programmatic checks pass.
