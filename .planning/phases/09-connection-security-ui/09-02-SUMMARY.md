# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 09-01
    provides: SecurityBadge component with lock/lock-open/home icons
provides:
  - HttpWarningBanner component with dismissal persistence
  - Complete security UI integration in app layout
  - Warning for HTTP connections with localStorage-based dismissal
affects: [ui, security-indicators, session-management]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Dismissible warning banners with localStorage persistence
    - Security component integration via Portal pattern in titlebar
    - Multiple security indicators working in harmony

key-files:
  created:
    - packages/app/src/components/http-warning-banner.tsx
  modified:
    - packages/app/src/pages/layout.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "localStorage for banner dismissal: Session-scoped would re-show warning every session, persistent dismissal better UX"
  - "SecurityBadge before SessionIndicator in titlebar: Security status more fundamental than session info"
  - "Banner immediately below titlebar: High visibility for security warnings without blocking critical UI"

patterns-established:
  - "Security warning pattern: dismissible banner with localStorage persistence and security detection logic"
  - "Layered security UI: badge for status at a glance + banner for urgent warnings"

# Phase 09 Plan 02: Connection Security UI Summary

**Dismissible HTTP warning banner with localStorage persistence integrated into app layout alongside SecurityBadge in titlebar**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2min 8s
- **Started:** 2026-01-24T21:12:24Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-24T21:14:32Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created HttpWarningBanner component with security detection and dismissal
- Integrated SecurityBadge into titlebar using Portal pattern before SessionIndicator
- Positioned HttpWarningBanner below titlebar for high visibility
- Implemented localStorage persistence for banner dismissal

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create HttpWarningBanner component** - `6325552e6` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Integrate security components into layout** - `fec3369e9` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/app/src/components/http-warning-banner.tsx` - Dismissible HTTP warning banner with localStorage persistence and security detection
- `packages/app/src/pages/layout.tsx` - Added SecurityBadge to titlebar-right Portal and HttpWarningBanner below Titlebar

## Decisions Made

**1. localStorage for banner dismissal persistence**

- Rationale: Session-scoped storage would re-show warning every session; persistent dismissal provides better UX while still showing on first visit
- Implementation: `opencode:security-warning-dismissed` key set to "true" on dismiss

**2. SecurityBadge positioned before SessionIndicator**

- Rationale: Connection security status is more fundamental than session information; should appear first in visual hierarchy
- Implementation: Wrapped both in flex container with gap-2 inside Portal

**3. Banner positioned immediately below Titlebar**

- Rationale: High visibility for security warnings without blocking critical UI; naturally pushes content down when visible, reclaims space when dismissed
- Implementation: Inserted `<HttpWarningBanner />` between Titlebar and main content area

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all components compiled and built successfully on first attempt.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. Components are self-contained and ready for user testing.

## Next Phase Readiness

Connection Security UI phase complete. Both SecurityBadge and HttpWarningBanner working together:

- SecurityBadge visible at all times in titlebar for quick security status check
- HttpWarningBanner appears for HTTP non-localhost connections with clear warning message
- User can dismiss banner; dismissal persists via localStorage
- Both components use same security detection logic (localhost/HTTPS checks)

Ready for user acceptance testing across different connection scenarios:

- HTTP localhost (no banner, blue badge)
- HTTPS remote (no banner, green badge)
- HTTP remote (banner on first visit, red badge)
