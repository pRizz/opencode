# Phase 5 Plan 09: Auth Enforcement on PTY Routes Summary

**PTY routes enforce authentication when enabled and pass session ID for broker PTY creation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min (267 seconds)
- **Started:** 2026-01-22T11:42:55Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-22T11:47:22Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 2 (+ 1 created)

## Accomplishments

- Auth middleware now provides structured AuthContext with sessionId
- PTY routes (POST, PUT, DELETE) check auth when enabled
- Routes return 401 for unauthenticated requests when auth enabled
- SessionId passed to Pty.create for broker-based PTY spawning
- 11 tests covering auth enforcement logic

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add session ID to auth middleware context** - `f12a1f3e2` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update PTY routes to use session context** - `b5249f055` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Add tests for auth enforcement** - `6f0ee7cc4` (test)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/opencode/src/server/middleware/auth.ts` - Added AuthContext interface, sessionId to context, getAuthContext helper
- `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/pty.ts` - Added auth checks to POST, PUT, DELETE routes
- `packages/opencode/test/server/routes/pty-auth.test.ts` - Auth enforcement tests (11 tests)

## Decisions Made

1. **AuthContext structure** - Interface with sessionId, username, uid, gid for route access
2. **Route-level auth checks** - Even though middleware handles auth, routes double-check for critical operations
3. **Conditional sessionId** - Only pass to Pty.create when auth enabled, undefined otherwise

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Auth middleware provides complete session context
- PTY routes enforce auth when enabled
- Ready for Plan 10: Integration test harness
