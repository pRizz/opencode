# Dependency graph
requires: []
provides:
  - Duration string parsing utility
  - AuthConfig Zod schema for PAM authentication
  - AuthPamConfig schema for PAM-specific settings

key-decisions:
  - "Duration schema validates strings but stores raw values (not transformed to ms)"
  - "Auth config uses .strict() to reject unknown fields per codebase convention"

patterns-established:
  - "Duration validation pattern: z.string().refine() with ms package"
  - "Auth config structure: method-aware with pam-specific nested config"

# Phase 1 Plan 1: Auth Config Schema Summary

**Duration utility with ms package and AuthConfig Zod schema for PAM authentication configuration**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T11:53:51Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T11:56:02Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Created Duration schema that validates strings like '30m', '1h', '7d' using ms package
- Created parseDuration helper for converting duration strings to milliseconds at usage time
- Created AuthConfig schema with all fields from CONTEXT.md (enabled, method, sessionTimeout, rememberMeDuration, requireHttps, rateLimiting, allowedUsers, sessionPersistence, trustProxy)
- Created AuthPamConfig schema with service field for PAM-specific configuration

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add ms package and create duration utility** - `05434ab54` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create auth configuration schema** - `a227c9933` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/opencode/src/util/duration.ts` - Duration schema and parseDuration helper using ms package
- `packages/opencode/src/config/auth.ts` - AuthConfig and AuthPamConfig Zod schemas
- `packages/opencode/package.json` - Added ms and @types/ms dependencies
- `bun.lock` - Updated lockfile

## Decisions Made

1. **Duration strings stored as-is**: Duration schema validates but doesn't transform to milliseconds. Transformation happens at usage time via parseDuration(). This matches how other config fields work (store config value, not processed form).

2. **Type assertion for ms package**: Used `as ms.StringValue` for TypeScript compatibility since the ms types expect template literal types but we receive arbitrary strings from Zod validation.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

1. **Bun version mismatch for build script**: The build script requires bun@1.3.5 but environment has bun@1.3.6. Used `bun run typecheck` instead for verification, which succeeded.

2. **ms package type constraints**: The @types/ms expects `StringValue` template literal types. Resolved with type assertion after Zod validation.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Duration utility ready for use in auth config validation
- AuthConfig schema ready for integration into Config.Info in next plan
- All schemas follow codebase conventions (.strict(), .meta())
