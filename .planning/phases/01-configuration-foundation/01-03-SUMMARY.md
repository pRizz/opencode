# Phase 1 Plan 3: PAM Startup Validation Summary

**PAM service file validation at startup with fail-fast error when auth is enabled but service file missing**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 7 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T12:00:44Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T12:08:07Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Added PAM service file validation in Config.state() after all config merging
- Validation only triggers when auth.enabled is true
- Uses configured pam.service name or defaults to "opencode"
- Throws PamServiceNotFoundError with actionable setup instructions if file missing
- Verified backward compatibility: opencode starts normally when auth is absent or disabled

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add PAM service file validation to config loading** - `a0dc81d24` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Verify backward compatibility** - (verification only, no code changes)

**Plan metadata:** (pending)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/opencode/src/config/config.ts` - Added PAM validation after config merging

## Decisions Made

1. **Validation after all config merging**: The PAM check runs after all config sources are merged, ensuring we validate the final effective configuration.

2. **Startup-only validation**: Per CONTEXT.md, this validates PAM service file exists at startup. If the file is deleted later, that's handled at auth time in future phases.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 1 (Configuration Foundation) complete
- Auth configuration schema defined and integrated
- PAM validation ensures fail-fast on misconfiguration
- Ready for Phase 2 (PAM Authentication)

**Phase Success Criteria Met:**

1. User can add auth configuration block to opencode.json - DONE
2. opencode starts normally when auth config is absent - VERIFIED
3. opencode validates auth config and reports clear errors - DONE
4. Auth is disabled by default when config section is missing - VERIFIED
