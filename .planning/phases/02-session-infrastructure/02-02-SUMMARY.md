# Phase 2 Plan 2: Auth Middleware and Routes Summary

**Hono auth middleware with session validation, sliding expiration, and auth routes for logout (single session and all sessions)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-20T13:59:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-20T14:02:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files created:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Auth middleware validates session cookie and checks idle timeout
- Sliding expiration: each authenticated request updates lastAccessTime
- POST /auth/logout clears current session
- POST /auth/logout/all clears all sessions for user (logout everywhere)
- GET /auth/session returns current session info
- Auth is skipped when config.auth.enabled is false (backward compatible)
- Cookie is HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Secure only on HTTPS

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create auth middleware for session validation** - `277e20dad` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create auth routes for logout functionality** - `ed734238c` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Integrate auth middleware and routes into server** - `732d6e02b` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/opencode/src/server/middleware/auth.ts` - Auth middleware with session validation, timeout check, and context variables
- `packages/opencode/src/server/routes/auth.ts` - Auth routes: POST /logout, POST /logout/all, GET /session
- `packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts` - Server integration with authMiddleware and AuthRoutes

## Decisions Made

- **Middleware placement:** authMiddleware placed after cors but before Instance.provide, so auth happens early in the chain but still has CORS headers
- **AuthRoutes as global:** Mounted at /auth before Instance.provide since logout doesn't require project context
- **Secure cookie conditional:** Only set Secure flag when URL starts with https://, allowing local development without HTTPS

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Auth middleware and routes ready for PAM authentication integration (02-03)
- Session validation flow complete: cookie -> session lookup -> timeout check -> context population
- Login endpoint (Phase 4) will use setSessionCookie to establish sessions
