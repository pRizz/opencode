# Roadmap: Opencode System Authentication

## Overview

This roadmap delivers PAM-based system authentication for opencode's web interface, following the Cockpit model. Starting with configuration and session infrastructure, we build toward a privileged auth broker that enables multi-user access where commands execute under the authenticated user's identity. The journey proceeds from foundation (config, sessions) through core authentication (broker, PAM, process spawning), then UI and security hardening, and concludes with polish features (2FA, documentation).

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
