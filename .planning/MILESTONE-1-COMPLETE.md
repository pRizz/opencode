| 11    | Documentation             | 4     | 9.9 min  | ✅ Complete |

**Total:** 43 plans, 224.5 minutes (3.7 hours)

## Key Deliverables

### Core Authentication System

- ✅ PAM-based authentication with system credentials
- ✅ Privileged auth broker (Rust) for secure credential validation
- ✅ Session management with configurable timeouts
- ✅ User process execution under authenticated UID/GID
- ✅ PTY allocation and terminal session management

### Security Features

- ✅ CSRF protection (double-submit cookie pattern)
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- ✅ HTTPS detection and enforcement
- ✅ Two-factor authentication (TOTP via PAM)
- ✅ Device trust for 2FA
- ✅ Secure session cookies (httpOnly, SameSite)

### User Interface

- ✅ Login page with password toggle
- ✅ Session indicator with username display
- ✅ Connection security badge (HTTPS/HTTP/local)
- ✅ 2FA verification page with countdown timer
- ✅ 2FA setup wizard with QR code generation
- ✅ Session expiration warnings

### Documentation

- ✅ Reverse proxy setup guide (nginx, Caddy)
- ✅ PAM configuration guide (Linux, macOS, 2FA, LDAP)
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide with diagnostic flowcharts
- ✅ Documentation index with quick start guide
- ✅ Production-ready configuration examples

## Verification

**UAT Status:** ✅ Passed (5/5 tests)

- Main README links to deployment docs
- Docs index has quick start and key links
- Reverse proxy docs and configs complete
- PAM configuration guide covers all core setups
- Troubleshooting guide includes flowcharts and common issues

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture

- **Privilege separation:** Auth broker runs as setuid root, web server runs unprivileged
- **IPC communication:** Unix socket-based protocol between web server and broker
- **Platform support:** Linux (systemd) and macOS (launchd) configurations
- **Backward compatible:** Auth disabled by default, existing usage unchanged

### Security Model

- **PAM integration:** Supports local users, LDAP/AD, 2FA via pam_google_authenticator
- **Session security:** HMAC binding, CSRF tokens, secure cookies
- **Rate limiting:** IP-based protection before PAM validation
- **HTTPS enforcement:** Configurable (off/warn/block) with localhost exemption

### Code Quality

- **Type safety:** Full TypeScript coverage with Zod validation
- **Error handling:** Consistent error types and user-friendly messages
- **Testing:** Integration tests for critical auth flows
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive guides for deployment and troubleshooting

## Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Average plan duration: 5.2 minutes
- Fastest phase: Phase 9 (2.3 min/plan)
- Most complex phase: Phase 5 (8.3 min/plan)
- Total execution time: 224.5 minutes (3.7 hours)

**Code Statistics:**

- Rust broker: ~2,000 lines (PAM integration, IPC server)
- TypeScript server: ~3,000 lines (auth routes, session management)
- TypeScript UI: ~2,500 lines (login, 2FA, session components)
- Documentation: ~3,500 lines (guides, configs, troubleshooting)

## Decisions Made

Key architectural decisions documented in STATE.md:

- Duration strings stored as-is (transform at usage)
- In-memory session storage (acceptable for MVP)
- Platform-specific PAM configs (Linux vs macOS)
- Separate PAM service for OTP validation
- Double-submit cookie CSRF pattern
- IP-based rate limiting (simpler than per-user)

## Known Limitations

**By Design:**

- Sessions lost on server restart (in-memory storage)
- Single-instance only (no session sharing across instances)
- Manual 2FA setup (users run CLI commands)

**Future Enhancements (Phases 12-15):**

- Server-side TOTP registration
- Passkeys investigation
- Persistent session storage
- Documentation updates for fork

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**

- Milestone archived, ready for next milestone planning
- Phases 12-15 identified for future work

**Future Milestones:**

- Phase 12: Server-Side TOTP Registration
- Phase 13: Passkeys Investigation
- Phase 14: Persistent Session Storage
- Phase 15: Documentation updates

## Lessons Learned

**What Worked Well:**

- Incremental phase approach (foundation → core → UI → polish)
- Platform-specific handling from the start (avoided later refactoring)
- Comprehensive documentation early (reduced support burden)
- UAT verification process (caught gaps before completion)

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Could have parallelized some UI work with backend
- Documentation could have been started earlier (Phase 9-10)
- More integration testing would catch edge cases earlier

## Team Notes
