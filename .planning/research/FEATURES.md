## Table Stakes

Features users expect from any system-authenticated web application. Missing any of these makes the product feel incomplete or insecure.

## Differentiators

Features that set the product apart. Not strictly required, but provide meaningful value for self-hosted remote access.

| Feature                             | Value Proposition                    | Complexity | Notes                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Remember me" / persistent sessions | Convenience for trusted devices      | Low        | Extended session expiry (e.g., 30 days); stored token with refresh |
| Insecure connection blocking        | Prevent credential exposure          | Low        | Option to refuse login over HTTP on public networks                |
| Multi-session awareness             | See other active sessions            | Medium     | List active sessions with IP/device info; revoke others            |
| Session activity indicator          | Know when session is about to expire | Low        | UI indicator showing time remaining; refresh on activity           |
| Automatic session refresh           | Keep working sessions alive          | Low        | Background keepalive while tab is active                           |
| Connection security badge           | Visual trust indicator               | Low        | Lock icon + "Secure" vs warning for HTTP                           |
| Login page customization            | Branding for enterprise deployments  | Low        | Configurable logo/message on login page via config                 |

| 2FA support (TOTP)                  | Additional security layer            | Medium     | Optional; PAM can delegate to pam_google_authenticator or pam_oath |
| SSH key authentication              | Passwordless auth option             | High       | More complex; useful for automation/scripts                        |

## Anti-Features

Features to explicitly NOT build. Common mistakes or scope creep traps.

| Anti-Feature                  | Why Avoid                                                                         | What to Do Instead                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Custom user database          | Duplicates OS user management; maintenance burden                                 | Delegate entirely to PAM/passwd                     |
| Built-in TLS termination      | Complex, error-prone; better tools exist                                          | Document reverse proxy setup (nginx, Caddy)         |
| OAuth/SSO for self-hosted     | PAM already supports enterprise SSO via LDAP/Kerberos; complexity without benefit | Use PAM's SSO capabilities                          |
| Account registration          | Self-hosted = system accounts already exist                                       | Admins create system users via normal OS tools      |
| Password reset via email      | No email infrastructure assumption; security risk                                 | Users reset via sudo/admin or OS tools              |
| Fine-grained app permissions  | Duplicates sudo/polkit; consistency issues                                        | Use existing UNIX permission model                  |
| Session sharing between users | Security boundary violation                                                       | Sessions are per-user; admin can view via audit log |
| Anonymous/guest access        | Defeats purpose of system auth                                                    | Require authentication for all access               |
| Client-side session storage   | XSS vulnerability; tokens visible to JS                                           | Use HttpOnly cookies only                           |
| Remember password in browser  | Not application's job; browser handles this                                       | Let browser's password manager work                 |
| Automatic login               | Security risk; circumvents auth                                                   | Require explicit "remember me" action               |

**Critical path:**

1. PAM authentication must work before any session features
2. Session-to-UID mapping required before commands can execute
3. HTTPS detection should gate login (at least warn)

**Independent features:**

- Remember me (extension of session management)
- Multi-session awareness (enhancement, not blocking)
- 2FA (optional security layer)

## Phase Recommendations

### Phase 1: MVP Authentication (Table Stakes)

Build the minimum viable authenticated system:

1. **Login Form UI** - Username/password form with basic styling
2. **PAM Backend** - Authenticate credentials via PAM
3. **Session Cookies** - Create/validate session, HttpOnly + Secure
4. **Logout** - Clear session
5. **HTTPS Warning** - Detect insecure, show warning (don't block yet)
6. **CSRF Protection** - Token for login form

**Why this order:** Can't test sessions without login, can't test logout without sessions.

### Phase 2: Security Hardening

1. **Session Timeout** - Configurable idle expiry
2. **Brute-force Protection** - App-layer rate limiting (supplement PAM)
3. **Insecure Connection Blocking** - Option to refuse HTTP login
4. **Session-to-UID Mapping** - Commands execute under correct user

**Why this order:** Timeout is simpler; UID mapping is highest complexity but core value.

### Phase 3: UX Polish

1. **Remember Me** - Persistent sessions for trusted devices
2. **Session Activity Indicator** - Time remaining UI
3. **Automatic Session Refresh** - Keepalive while active
4. **Password Visibility Toggle** - Eye icon
5. **Keyboard Navigation** - Accessibility

### Phase 4: Advanced (Optional)

1. **Multi-Session Awareness** - List/revoke sessions
2. **2FA Support** - TOTP via PAM module
3. **Privilege Escalation UI** - sudo prompts for admin actions

## Complexity Assessment

| Complexity | Features                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low**    | Login form, logout, session cookies, CSRF, HTTPS warning, session timeout, remember me, UI indicators, password toggle |
| **Medium** | PAM integration, brute-force protection, multi-session tracking, 2FA                                                   |
| **High**   | Session-to-UID mapping (requires privilege escalation design), SSH key auth, sudo UI                                   |

## Cockpit Reference Points

Based on Cockpit's authentication model (from training data):

1. **Direct PAM** - Cockpit authenticates directly via PAM, not a custom layer
2. **Session = UNIX User** - 1:1 mapping, no invented permissions
3. **Privilege via Polkit** - Admin actions prompt for sudo password
4. **TLS via External** - Cockpit expects reverse proxy for production
5. **HTTP Warning** - Shows "Not Secure" but allows login locally
6. **Session Timeout** - Configurable, default 15 minutes
7. **No User Management** - Doesn't create users; delegates to OS

## Risk Areas

| Risk                                               | Mitigation                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| PAM integration complexity varies by OS            | Focus on Linux; macOS as secondary                |
| Session-to-UID requires elevated privileges        | Design setuid helper or run as root               |
| HTTP detection has edge cases (proxies, localhost) | Trust X-Forwarded-Proto from trusted proxies only |
| Brute-force handling differs across PAM modules    | Add app-layer rate limiting as backup             |
